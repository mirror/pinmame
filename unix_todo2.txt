The build was done on a Ubuntu 18.04 Virtual machine

makefile.unix:
TARGET   = pinmame
LIBS     = -L/usr/lib/X11 -L/usr/lib
INCLUDES = -I/usr/include/X11 -I/usr/include
ARCH     = linux
DISPLAY_METHOD = x11
X11INC   = -I/usr/include/X11
X11LIB   = -L/usr/lib/X11
 

Since using X11 for my output testing I made sure I have the X11 debian packages.

Here is the list of the packages I made sure were present for a successful compile
(There are some sound packages that I neglected to note what they were)
zlib1g-dev
libx11-dev
libxext-dev
libxv-dev
x11proto-video-dev
libsdl2-dev
libsdl1.2-dev

 
To launch the compile ...

make -f makefile.unix
 

To clean up after failed compile

make clean -f makefile.unix
 

The completed object file is xpinmame.x11
